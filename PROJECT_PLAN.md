# Task/Project Management API - Project Plan

## Overview

A comprehensive NestJS-based Task and Project Management API with JWT authentication, role-based access control, and MongoDB integration. This project will demonstrate advanced NestJS concepts including CRUD operations, user authentication, database relations, and scheduled tasks.

## Learning Objectives

- **CRUD Operations**: Master Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for complex data models
- **User Authentication**: Implement JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- **Database Relations**: Work with MongoDB relations using Mongoose populate
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Implement different permission levels (admin, user)
- **API Design**: Build RESTful APIs with proper HTTP status codes and error handling
- **Scheduling**: Use @nestjs/schedule for automated notifications and reminders

## Core Features

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure login/logout with access and refresh tokens
- **Role-Based Access Control**:
  - `admin`: Full system access, user management
  - `user`: Project and task management within assigned projects
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing with salt rounds
- **Token Management**: Automatic token refresh and secure storage

### 2. Project Management

- **Project CRUD**: Create, read, update, delete projects
- **Project Members**: Assign team members to projects
- **Project Status**: Track project lifecycle (planning, active, completed, archived)
- **Project Permissions**: Control who can view/edit projects

### 3. Task Management

- **Task CRUD**: Full task lifecycle management
- **Task Assignment**: Assign tasks to team members
- **Task Status Tracking**:
  - `todo`: Not started
  - `in-progress`: Currently being worked on
  - `done`: Completed
  - `blocked`: Cannot proceed due to dependencies
- **Task Dependencies**: Link tasks that depend on each other
- **Task Priority**: High, Medium, Low priority levels

### 4. Subtask System

- **Hierarchical Tasks**: Create subtasks under main tasks
- **Nested Management**: Full CRUD for subtasks
- **Progress Tracking**: Calculate parent task progress based on subtasks

### 5. Collaboration Features

- **Comments System**: Add comments to tasks and projects
- **File Attachments**: Upload and manage file links
- **Activity Logs**: Track all changes and updates
- **Mentions**: @mention team members in comments

### 6. Advanced Features

- **Pagination & Filtering**:
  - `/tasks?status=in-progress&assignee=userId&page=1&limit=10`
  - `/projects?status=active&member=userId`
- **Search Functionality**: Full-text search across tasks and projects
- **Notifications**: Email notifications for task assignments and updates
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Automated reminders and status updates
